The code was organised in this format to help ensure clarity in procedure and enable the user some flexibility in changing some inputs into some functions. The following is an explanation of the purpose of each function:\n\n**The spool_values function**: This function is the first call to be made in this code structure. It programmatically accesses the World Bank API and downloads the relevant data for our specified variables and countries. Its inputs is the dictionary-type variable called \"indicators\" above and the list-type variables called \"countries_list above\". It returns a pandas dataframe containing values from 1960 - 2021 (or the most recent year in the database) for all countries in  \"countries_list\" and all variables in \"indicators\". \n\n**The clean_data function**: This function is called second and takes as the resulting dataframe from the \"spool_values\" function as an input. The intention of this function is to systematically reduce missing variables in the dataset. It does this by;\n* It calls in the dataset spooled from the WDI from the spool_values function above.\n* If the NaN_drop variable is True, it executes a conditional statement. This argument in the function uses the NaN_perc variable to drop (delete) rows with missing values less than NaN_perc. For example, if NaN_drop is True and NaN_perc is 60%, then every row in our dataset that has 40% or more of its values missing is deleted from the dataset. For example, if Japan in 1972 has 41% of the variables missing, that year is dropped from our dataset. \n* If the country_drop variable is True, it executes a conditional statement. This argument uses the cut_off variable to drop all data for a country in our dataset that does not have at least a set percentage of the annual data available. For example, if country_drop is True and cut_off is 60%, then if Japan does not have at least 37 years of annual data in the dataset, it is dropped entirely. (1960 – 2021 represents 61 years)\nThe issue of missing data is significant given that we are working with many countries and will eventually fill in missing data in our dataset. The idea is to try as much as possible to maintain the data structure such that annual data and countries that have a lot of missing values are dropped entirely. In the original report we have used a threshold of 50% for missing variables in the row and 50% for number of rows (years) which a country must have to remain in the data.\n!!Any subsequent users can change the cutoff for rows and countrys should they wish to vary the criteria with which missing variables are treated in the context explained above. The values can range from 1 to 100.\n\n**The fill_values function**: The fill_values function is executed on a country-by-country basis. It uses the dataset outputted by the clean_data function above. The function uses the K-nearest neighbor model to make predictions for missing values in our model and fill all missing data. If the neighbors' argument is specified as 3, the model will use the nearest three annual data to a missing datapoint to predict the missing value. \nFor example, in our dataset, if the birth rate variable was missing for Japan in 1972, the model uses 1969, 1970, and 1971 birth rate data points for Japan to predict the missing 1972 value. Please note that this imputation is done on a country-by-country basis. The output of this function is a dataframe will all missing values predicted.\n!! Any subsequent users can change the neighbors argument to values above 3 should they wish to change how the KNN model predicts the missing values. A value of 3 or 5 is usually recommended.\nPlease see the [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-use-of-knn-for-missing-values-cf33d935c637) here for more explanation of the KNN imputation technique. \n\n**The visualise_missing function**: The visualize_missing function is used to create a graphical representation of missing values in our dataset. This is simply an informative graph to help us understand which variables in the dataset have the most missing values. This function is applied to the output of the spool_values, clean_data and fill_values functions to see the ratio of missing variables in the dataframe.\n\n**The standardization function**: This function standardizes the dataframe outputed from the \"fill_values\" function. Standardising a dataset involves rescaling the distribution of values so that the mean of observed values is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This process is essential primarily when the different variables used in ML models have different scales (Brownlee, 2016). This prevents variables that have higher orders from biasing the model.The output of this function is simply the same dataframe but rescaled such that the mean and standard deviation are 0 and 1 respectively.\n\n**The feature_engineering function**: This function simply performs feature engineering by creating three new variables from the variables already in the dataset. We perform feature engineering to create three variables: trade openness (import + export/ GDP), CO2 emission per capita (CO2 emission (kt)/ Total population) and Air Transportation per capita (Air Transportation (number of passengers)/ Total population). The import, export and total population columns are then dropped because they are not among the list of variables which we employ in our modelling. \n!!Any subsequent users should delete this function if they do not intend to have these features (variables) in the dataset which they use to fit their own models. An error will be thrown if the import, export and population variables were not part of the originally spooled variables from the WB database.\n\n**The economy_classification function**: This function will add a column to the output of the \"feature_engineering\" dataset in preparation for the supervised machine learning. The new column is the dependent variable column featuring the three classes necessary for the analysis. Developing economies take the class 0, transition economies take the class 1 and developed economies take the class two. This class assignment is done based on the developing_economies, emerging economies and developed_economies list specified above and culled based on the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2022 report. \n\n**The unsupervised_ML function**: This function fits an usupervised ML model to produce clusters for the dataset. It's arguments (inputs) include:\n*            dataframe; The dataset\n*            year: The specific year for the countries in the dataset on which to run the cluster algorithm on\n*            clusters: The number of clusters to include in our dataset. The report form of this work uses five clusters for the economies in the dataset.\n*            model: Either the KMeans or GMM model.\nThe output of this function is a dataset with a list of countries and the cluster assignment for each country, along with a two principal component analysis variables should the user which to visualise the dimensioanlity reduction of the variables supplied to the model.\n\n**The supervised_ML function**: This function fits a supervised ML model to understand and predict the three classes supplied to the model. It's arguments include:\n*            dataframe; The dataset\n*            split_size: The size of the randomly selected test dataset (the size used for the report is 30%)\n*            clusters: The number of clusters to include in our dataset\n*            model: Either the RFC, SVMC, or XGBC\n*            excluded_country: The country to be excluded should the user which to perform an out of sample prediction. This country is excluded from the model fitting  process and then its class predicted with the fitted model.\nThere are two outputs for this function. First the fitted model, from which the feature importance listing is derived and the out-of-sample test data should the user choose to select one. However, while fitting the model, the confusion matrix is printed.\n!!If the user does not want to include any country for out of sample testing, then this argument should take the value of \"None\".\n\n**The feature_importance_graph function**: This function returns a graph of the feature importance for the variables used in either of the three models in the supervised_ML function. It takes the following arguments:\n* fitted_model: The variable in which the model for the supervised_ml was saved into\n* model_name: Either the RFC, SVMC, or XGBC (this must align with the model into which the supervised_ML was saved into.)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def spool_values(variables, countries):\n    \"\"\"This is a function that returns the listed indicator values\n        Args:\n            indicators; a dictionary containing required indicator codes and name\n            countries_list: A list of countries which we require for our dataset\n        Returns: a dataframe of data queried from the World Bank Development Indicators DataBase\n        \"\"\"\n    wbdata.get_source()\n    wbdata.get_indicator(source=2)\n    print(\"Spooling data for \" + str(len(variables)) + \" variables, across \" + str(len(countries)) + \" economies.\")\n    df = wbdata.get_dataframe(variables, country=\"all\", cache=True)\n    df = df.reset_index(level=0)\n    df = df.reset_index(level=0)\n    final = df[df['country'].isin(countries)]\n    return final\n\n\ndef clean_data(dataframe, NaN_drop, NaN_perc, country_drop, cutoff):\n    \"\"\"This is a function that cleans a dataframe based on the number of missing variables that exists in each row.
